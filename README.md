Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:

> cd manager
> npm install
> npm install -g react-native-cli
> react-native run-ios // need xcode installed 
> react-native run-android // need android studio installed and jre, i guess. (personally, I used only ios)
