Assuming that you have <b>Node</b> installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:

cd manager
</br>npm install
</br>npm install -g react-native-cli
</br>react-native run-ios // need xcode installed 
</br>react-native run-android // need android studio installed and jre, i guess. (personally, I used only ios)
